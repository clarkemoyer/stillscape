# Template Setup Checklist

Quick reference checklist for setting up a new repository from the FFC Single Page Template.

**For complete instructions, see [TEMPLATE_USAGE.md](./TEMPLATE_USAGE.md)**

---

## Initial Repository Creation

- [ ] Click "Use this template" button on GitHub
- [ ] Create new repository with kebab-case name
- [ ] Add repository description and topics
- [ ] Clone repository locally
- [ ] Run `npm install` to verify dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify build works
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` to test locally

---

## Essential GitHub Settings (Required)

### General Settings (Settings → General)

- [ ] Set repository description
- [ ] Add topics (nextjs, nonprofit, static-site, etc.)
- [ ] Enable Issues
- [ ] Enable Discussions (optional)

### GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages)

- [ ] **Source: GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch" — this repo's
      `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` uploads a Pages artifact via
      `actions/deploy-pages`; there is no `gh-pages` branch)
- [ ] Custom domain (if applicable): Enter domain name and click "Save"
- [ ] Wait for DNS check to complete
- [ ] Enable "Enforce HTTPS" (after DNS configured)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` is now selected automatically by
      `deploy.yml` and `lighthouse.yml` from `public/CNAME` (empty when
      CNAME is present, `/<repo-name>` when it's not). No manual edit
      required.

### Actions Permissions (Settings → Actions → General)

- [ ] Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- [ ] Workflow permissions: Read and write permissions
- [ ] Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests ✅

### Security & Analysis (Settings → Security & Analysis)

- [ ] Enable Dependency graph ✅
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts ✅
- [ ] Enable Dependabot security updates ✅
- [ ] Enable Code scanning (CodeQL) - use **default setup** (do NOT add a `codeql.yml` advanced workflow; it conflicts with default setup)
- [ ] Enable Secret scanning (if available)

---

## Branch Protection Rules (Settings → Rules → Rulesets)

Create ruleset named "Protect Main":

- [ ] Target branches: Include default branch (main)
- [ ] Restrict deletions ✅
- [ ] Require pull request before merging ✅
- [ ] Require status checks to pass:
  - [ ] Test and Build (CI workflow)
  - [ ] CodeQL (code scanning default setup; appears after first scan)
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date ✅
- [ ] Require signed commits ✅
- [ ] Block force pushes ✅

**Set up commit signing**: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits

---

## Update Repository Configuration Files

### basePath in Workflows — automatic

`deploy.yml` and `lighthouse.yml` derive `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` from
`public/CNAME` at build time:

- **Custom domain** (CNAME file present): build uses empty basePath so
  asset URLs resolve from the origin root.
- **github.io subpath** (no CNAME): build uses `/<repo-name>` so asset
  URLs resolve under the Pages subpath.

You don't have to edit either workflow when you rename the repo.

### Update CODEOWNERS

- [ ] Edit `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- [ ] Replace `@clarkemoyer` with your GitHub usernames/teams

### Update FUNDING.yml (Optional)

- [ ] Edit `.github/FUNDING.yml`
- [ ] Update GitHub Sponsors username
- [ ] Update custom donation links

---

## Customize Content and Branding

### Organization Information (use `siteConfig`, NOT find-and-replace)

- [ ] Edit `src/lib/site.config.ts` — sets the name, URL, description,
      twitter handle, contact email, social links, theme color
      everywhere they're consumed (title, OG/Twitter, footer, 404,
      manifest, sitemap, robots, security headers)
- [ ] Run `npm run check:drift` after editing — the placeholder-URL
      and CSP-sync rules will flag anything still pointing at
      `ffcworkingsite1.org` or out of sync
- [ ] Set the EIN, mailing addresses, phone number, and GuideStar
      profile links in `src/lib/site.config.ts` — `ein`, `phone`,
      `addresses`, and `guidestar.profileUrl` / `guidestar.directProfileUrl`.
      The footer reads these from siteConfig; no footer code edit needed.

### Contact Information

- [ ] `siteConfig.contactEmail` drives the footer e-mail link
- [ ] Update `public/.well-known/security.txt` `Contact:` line (RFC
      9116 requires it on the file itself; drift check warns on stale)
- [ ] Update `SECURITY.md` — Security contact
- [ ] Update `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Conduct reporting contact
- [ ] Update `SUPPORT.md` — Support resources

### Branding Assets

- [ ] Replace `public/favicon.ico`, `public/icon.png`,
      `public/apple-icon.png`, `public/android-chrome-{192,512}.png`,
      and `public/web-app-manifest-512x512.png` with the charity's
      branded assets (KEEP the filenames so layout.tsx and manifest.ts
      pick them up automatically)
- [ ] Replace the header logo: `src/components/header/index.tsx` uses
      `assetPath('/Images/logo.webp')`. Swap `public/Images/logo.webp`
      for your charity's logo (keep the filename, or update the path in
      the header).
- [ ] Replace the OG / Twitter card image — `layout.tsx` references
      `/Images/og-image.png` (1200×630 landscape). Drop your own
      1200×630 image at `public/Images/og-image.png` (keep the
      filename). The square `web-app-manifest-512x512.png` stays as the
      PWA / app icon and JSON-LD logo.
- [ ] Replace branded images and SVGs under `public/Images/` and
      `public/Svgs/`
- [ ] Update color scheme in `src/app/globals.css`
- [ ] Update fonts in `src/app/layout.tsx` (if needed)

### Content Data

- [ ] Update team members in `src/data/team/` (name, role, optional LinkedIn — no photos; cards use initials monograms)
- [ ] Update FAQs in `src/data/faqs/`
- [ ] Update testimonials in `src/data/testimonials/`

### Documentation

- [ ] Update `README.md` with your information
- [ ] Update `MAINTAINERS.md` with your maintainers
- [ ] Update `GOVERNANCE.md` for your processes
- [ ] Update `CITATION.cff` with your details
- [ ] Review and customize `CONTRIBUTING.md`

---

## Optional Features

### Lighthouse CI GitHub Integration

- [ ] Create a **fine-grained** or **repository-scoped** GitHub token limited to this repository with the minimal permissions Lighthouse CI needs (for example, read access to contents and pull requests; avoid classic PATs with broad `repo` scope).
- [ ] Add this least-privilege token to repository secrets as `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN`
- [ ] Note: This enables PR comments and status checks; without it, Lighthouse runs but only stores results locally

### Preview Deployments

**Option A: Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)**

- [ ] Sign up at pages.cloudflare.com
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure build settings:
  - Framework: Next.js (Static HTML Export)
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Output: `out`
- [ ] Enable automatic preview deployments
- [ ] Enable PR comments

**Option B: Vercel**

- [ ] Sign up at vercel.com
- [ ] Import GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure settings (auto-detected for Next.js)
- [ ] Deploy

### Merge Queue

- [ ] Enable merge queue in Settings → Pull Requests
- [ ] Configure maximum queue size (5-10)
- [ ] Set check interval (5 minutes)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Deployment fails with "Resource not accessible"

✅ **Solution**: Enable "Read and write permissions" and "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" in Settings → Actions → General

### GitHub Pages shows 404

✅ **Solution**:

1. Verify Pages source is set to **"GitHub Actions"** (Settings → Pages → Source)
2. Wait 2-5 minutes for propagation
3. Check Actions tab for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow status
4. Confirm the "Determine base path" step in the deploy run printed the
   expected value (empty for custom-domain deploys, `/<repo-name>` for
   subpath deploys)
5. If you have a custom domain, confirm `public/CNAME` contains it
   (no scheme, no trailing slash)

### Images don't load on GitHub Pages

✅ **Solution**:

1. Check the deploy run's "Determine base path" step printed the
   expected value for your setup (empty with CNAME, `/<repo-name>` without)
2. Confirm all image references use the `assetPath()` helper — `npm run
check:drift` will fail if any are missing
3. Rebuild and redeploy

### Commits rejected (unsigned)

✅ **Solution**: Set up GPG commit signing - https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits

### Dependabot PRs not created

✅ **Solution**:

1. Enable Dependabot alerts in Settings → Security & Analysis
2. Enable Dependabot security updates
3. Wait for scheduled run (Mondays 9:00 AM UTC)
4. Check Insights → Dependency graph for errors
