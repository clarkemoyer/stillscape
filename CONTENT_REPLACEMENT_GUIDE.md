## 12. TEAM SECTION

Introduce your charity's leadership team or key staff members.

| Section | Variable        | Current Free For Charity Content | Your Content                                  |

| Team    | Section Heading | "The Free For Charity Team"      | _(e.g., "Meet Our Team" or "Our Leadership")_ |

### Team Members

Each member is a JSON file in `src/data/team/` with just three fields: `name`,
`role`, and an optional `linkedinUrl`. **There are no photos** — every card
renders an initials monogram (first + last initial) on your brand color, so you
never have to source, size, or host portrait images. When `linkedinUrl` is set,
the whole card links to that profile in a new tab; omit it and the card is not a
link.

_Note: Add more team members or use fewer by adding/removing JSON files in `src/data/team/` (and their import in `src/data/team.ts`). A LinkedIn URL, when present, must be an `https://` link on `linkedin.com` (or a subdomain such as `www.` / `uk.`) — any other host (or a non-`https://` scheme) is ignored and the card simply renders without a link._
